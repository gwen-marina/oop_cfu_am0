# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
  It. Was. Hard! It was a little overwhelming at first, or very overwhelming, but then I actually got some help. Nick, Candace, and I had a Zoom meeting and Nick answered all of our questions. I wish I had done that sooner, or when I was on the super struggle bus. It felt hard, bad when it was rough, and then really amazing when things clicked and I managed to complete something.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
Still need to work on that. I really need to work on breaks and taking some breathers. I'm good at staying focused, my thing is I get super focused and that is also not conducive to learning at times. I need to pace myself better, but also be okay when things get hard. Walk away, regroup, and refresh.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
 I think right now I need a break. I legit need a day of sleep lol. I need to be nicer and kinder to myself. I need to be okay not knowing and learning. I need to be able to vent to at least one cohort mate, and I found my venting person, and that is a type of support I need. I need to be able to tell someone that I don't know a thing or don't understand, especially when it feels like most everyone else is on top of things.
